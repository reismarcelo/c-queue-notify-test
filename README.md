# c-queue-notify-test

A set of sample NSO services used for testing the c-queue-notify package

c-queue-test1 and c-queue-test2 are basically the same simple, template-based service to validate different notify monitors.

rest-test-server is just a CDB container and list used to test the notify monitor REST API callback.
